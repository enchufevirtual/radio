# Clone It 🏁

### Clone repo

cd radio-client
```

### Node

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (**v18.14.2**)

npm install

##### Development

All the frontend works on port 3000, if you already have it in use change this port in the webpack.config.js file

##### Running the Frontend

Before running the `npm run start` command to start the frontend, ensure that the backend is already running. The frontend depends on the availability of the backend to function properly.

If you haven't set up and started the backend yet, please follow the instructions provided in the [backend's README](https://github.com/enchufevirtual/radio-api) to configure it correctly.

Once you have your backend ready and all this working correctly, you can execute the following command in your frontend directory.

```
npm run start
```

##### Production

```
npm run build
```
